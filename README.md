# New CMM Design

Nick, to preview the site, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo at `git clone https://github.com/TheFundamentalShape/cmm-new.git`. This can be cloned into any directory, even your `Sites` directory if you're using Laravel Valet.
2. `cd cmm-new` to get into the site's folder. 
3. Run `npm install` to install Tailwind and a few other things from NPM.
4. Grab live-server at `npm install live-server`.
5. Run the `build` script to compile Tailwind and any other CSS by running `npm run build`.
6. Boot up your live server. You'll want to serve this site from the `public` directory. You can do this by running `live-server public/`.
